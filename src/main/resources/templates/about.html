        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all started in our family kitchen, where generations came together to share meals and stories. We realized
            that food has the power to connect people, and we wanted to extend that connection to a broader community.
            Thus, Food Recipes was bornâ€”a platform to share our love for cooking and the cherished recipes that have
            been passed down through the years.</p>
